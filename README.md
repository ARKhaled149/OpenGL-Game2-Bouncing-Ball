# OpenGL-Game2-Bouncing-Ball (Oct 2019 - Nov 2019)
We built a 3D environment for a bouncing ball game using OpenGL. The main  game idea is that there is a bouncing ball shot into a cuboid room. The roomâ€™s walls are formed of differently  colored bricks. The ball bounces between these walls with normal reflections, and free from any gravity or other  forces than the initial shooting force.
