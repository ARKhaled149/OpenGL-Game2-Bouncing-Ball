# OpenGL-Game2-Bouncing-Ball
We built a 3D environment for a bouncing ball game using OpenGL. The main  game idea is that there is a bouncing ball shot into a cuboid room. The room’s walls are formed of differently  colored bricks. The ball bounces between these walls with normal reflections, and free from any gravity or other  forces than the initial shooting force.
